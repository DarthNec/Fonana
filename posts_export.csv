TraderTraitor üá∞üáµ North Korea\\n\\nThat very Bybit hack for almost $1.5 billion was their doing. TraderTraitor creates fake accounts (or uses real hacked ones) and literally tracks every step of the right employee in order to send a phishing letter in time. It is considered an A+ team in the DPRK\\n\\n2. Gamaredon and Black Basta üá∑üá∫ Russia\\n\\nGamaredon is much less technologically advanced (compared to the DPRK), but they win with quantity and 24/7 work.\\n\\nOne (!) computer is infected with 80-120 variants of malware in order to destroy the infrastructure\\n\\nBlack Basta is aimed at the West. Steal data > encrypt and threaten to leak > demand ransom\\n\\n(I didn't hold a candle, but all these stories about hacking hospitals, when all the equipment there died, are attributed to them)\\n\\n3. CyberAv3ngers üáÆüá∑ Iran\\n\\nThey called themselves Hacktivists, but in addition to Jews, they terrorize American oil and gas companies and others. The US authorities promise 10 million dollars for information about them\\n\\n4. Brass Typhoon and Smishing Triad üá®üá≥ China\\n\\nBrass Typhoon attacks everything American - from the farmer's application for cow milking (not a joke) to shipping and logistics\\n\\nAnd Taiwan too - source code and designs of microcircuits, power grids, and so on\\n\\nSmishing Triad act differently. Smishing is a mix of SMS and phishing emails, they pretend to be companies (post office, tax office, utility companies, etc.) and steal money",image,Tech,/media/thumbposts/thumb_tech_1752770135_6522.webp,/media/posts/post_tech_1752770139_5216.webp,f,f,,SOL,3,0,0,2025-06-17 04:33:41.248,2025-07-18 03:50:12.625,,,,f,
cmc33peil001lqodmpluc0rg4,cmbvtqy84000gqowpvlo2r5tp,HISTORY:  Lancia's Genius Rally Tactics. Salt trucks,"On the 1983 Monte Carlo Rally the majority of the route was dry, with sporadic sections of snow put the rear wheel drive Lancia 037's at a significant disadvantage. Cesare Fiorio the teams manager ordered 300 tons of salt from Italy and had it spread over the stages, melting the snow and enabling the use of slicks. The other teams such as Audi did not know about this and went out on snow tires to find 90% of the stages on tarmac. Fiorio's tactic had worked out and gave the Lancia's an 11 minute advantage by the end of the event.\\nRemote video URL\\n\\nLancia first unleashed this tactic on a snowy 1983 Monte Carlo Rally, as a way of getting the two-wheel drive 037 to compete with the four-wheel drive Audi Quattro. After just four kilometres the factory Lancias stopped to change soft rear Tarmac tyres for studded ice tyres ‚Äì all of which had been specially developed for the 037 by Pirelli. The stop cost around one minute but was reckoned to be just about worth doing, although it was a marginal call. Lancia team supremo Cesare Fiorio was very fond of the tactic though: it created headlines and was completely outside of the box, highlighting the creative approach that Lancia took to its rally campaign. The fastest stop from the factory team was 49 seconds for Markku Alen: he was the quickest Lancia on the 26-kilometre Pinet to Uriage les Bains stage, where the pit stops were first tried, setting fifth fastest time overall. The times soon improved over the years with a 35 second stop in 1985\\n\\nWalter Rohrl, whose stop was a bit less slick, said: ""We had a big discussion about it first but we had to do it: without the studs we wouldn't have got up the hill. I was first and it was horrible just sitting there in the middle of the stage for a minute, doing nothing. There was a fantastic atmosphere though with all the spectators and journalists, just like a pit lane!""\\nIn the end, Rohrl and Alen finished first and second on the 1983 Monte, defeating the Audi Quattro of Stig Blomqvist (which was third) by nearly five minutes thanks to some inspired driving and those amazing pit stops.\\nLancia continued to use this tactic right up through the Group B period and into the Group A period.",image,Technology,/media/thumbposts/thumb_trading_1752770314_4856.webp,/media/posts/post_gaming_1752770406_1693.webp,f,f,,SOL,4,0,0,2025-06-19 08:10:20.733,2025-07-18 03:50:12.8,,,,f,

Up until the early 1950s, all technical drawings were done by hand using these tools.  This timing consuming and skillful task required accuracy, a keen knowledge of measurement, and an understanding of geometry. \\n\\n   Until Dr. Paul J Hanratty changed the game by inventing a program that could draw simple lines on the computer when they were the size of a room in.  Hanratty then worked with a research team at MIT to expand his work which resulted in a program called Pronto (Program for Numerical Tooling Operations) in 1957.  Also at MIT in 1962, the first graphical user interface using a light pen to draw on a cathode ray tube was presented by Ivan Sutherland.  This was called ""Sketchpad, A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System"".\\nIn the 1960's, key breakthroughs were the first digitizer and the first production interactive graphics manufacturing system, DAC-1.\\n\\n   The biggest jump in CAD was in the 1980's when Autodesk released AutoCAD in 1983.  This was a big step as computers were evolving alongside CAD.  With the use of AutoCAD and computers available at a larger scale, design engineering became vastly more affordable.\\n\\n   3D modeling came into the picture in 1987 with the release of Pro/ENGINEER.  In 1995, SolidWorks was released for use in Windows.",image,Technology,/media/thumbposts/thumb_education_1752770587_3088.webp,/media/posts/post_trading_1752770335_2756.webp,f,f,,SOL,2,0,0,2025-06-18 11:29:37.039,2025-07-18 03:50:11.691,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/72ef029b0edfa4e109b12bf5c7794f7d.png,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/images/72ef029b0edfa4e109b12bf5c7794f7d.png,,f,

cmc7i63y400njqoqgiq1lrdjv,cmbvtqy84000gqowpvlo2r5tp,Ferrari Patents Oval-Piston V12 With Weird Shared Conrods,"Ferrari has filed a patent for a revolutionary V12 engine featuring oval-shaped pistons, marking a significant departure from the conventional circular pistons used in virtually all internal combustion engines. These ""pill-shaped"" pistons‚Äîrectangular with rounded short sides‚Äîare designed to make the engine more longitudinally compact without sacrificing displacement or power. The innovative design orients the longer edge of each piston from the outer side of the block to the inner vee, potentially allowing Ferrari to create shorter engines that leave room for hybrid components.‚Å†\\n‚Å†\\nThe patent, filed with the European Patent Office, also reveals another groundbreaking feature‚Äîopposing pistons sharing a single connecting rod through a flexible joint system, further reducing the engine's length. This design could prove particularly valuable for Ferrari's future hypercars and grand tourers, enabling the company to maintain its iconic V12 engines while meeting increasingly stringent emissions regulations through hybridization.‚Å†\\n‚Å†\\nWhile not entirely unprecedented‚ÄîHonda experimented with oval pistons in its NR500 racing motorcycles in the late 1970s‚ÄîFerrari's approach appears unique in its execution. The patent drawings specifically show a V12 configuration, suggesting this technology could appear in future flagship models, potentially preserving Ferrari's legendary high-revving V12 sound and character while embracing partial electrification",image,Tech,/media/thumbposts/thumb_tech_1752770086_9940.webp,/media/posts/post_tech_1752770131_1817.webp,f,f,,SOL,4,0,0,2025-06-22 10:06:19.516,2025-07-18 03:50:12.58,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/5dcb792a48d8cb865fe8953afb6884ac.webp,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/images/thumb_5dcb792a48d8cb865fe8953afb6884ac.webp,,f,

Launched in 2018, Anom was marketed to criminal organizations as an unbreakable, encrypted communication tool.\\n\\nHowever, every message sent through Anom was secretly copied and accessed by law enforcement agencies in real time. The devices running Anom were specially modified to limit other features and ensure users relied solely on the app for communication.\\n\\nThis covert operation allowed authorities to infiltrate and monitor hundreds of criminal networks worldwide. Over 800 arrests were made across 16 countries, with seizures of drugs, weapons, luxury cars, and millions of dollars in cash and cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nWhile raising important privacy debates, Anom proved to be a powerful tool in disrupting organized crime and demonstrated the potential of innovative law enforcement strategies in the digital age.",image,Tech,/media/thumbposts/thumb_tech_1752770093_2518.webp,/media/posts/post_tech_1752770055_7417.webp,f,f,,SOL,5,0,0,2025-06-22 09:29:24.937,2025-07-18 03:50:12.582,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/d300ba25d12f34a9ac831ac1c0758284.jpg,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/images/thumb_d300ba25d12f34a9ac831ac1c0758284.webp,,f,

Instead of fully shifting to electrification, Porsche aims to provide a sustainable solution for sports cars and classic vehicles by developing a drop-in fuel that works with existing engines but has near-zero net carbon emissions.\\n\\nThe eFuel is produced by combining green hydrogen, generated through electrolysis using renewable energy, with captured carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or industrial sources. This process creates synthetic methanol, which is then refined into a fuel chemically similar to gasoline. When burned, it releases only the CO‚ÇÇ that was used in its production, making it a closed carbon cycle.\\n\\nPorsche's pilot plant is located in Punta Arenas, Chile, where strong and consistent winds provide ideal conditions for wind-powered electrolysis. The project is a collaboration between Porsche, HIF Global, Siemens Energy, and ExxonMobil. Production began in 2022, with plans to scale up significantly in the coming years, targeting 550 million liters annually by 2027.\\n\\nThis technology supports Porsche's vision of reducing the carbon footprint of its combustion engines without sacrificing performance or heritage. It also offers a promising alternative fuel for motorsports and long-term sustainability in the automotive industry.",image,Tech,/media/thumbposts/thumb_tech_1752770146_9688.webp,/media/posts/post_tech_1752770096_3976.webp,f,f,,SOL,3,0,0,2025-06-23 15:11:44.938,2025-07-18 03:50:12.648,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/b03f47911a84f6514e51b386c29655d4.jpg,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/images/thumb_b03f47911a84f6514e51b386c29655d4.webp,,f,

cmca8bzir00auqosugeb3lpjq,cmc0apnf90038qoublubz4128,The First Instant Noodles: A Japanese Invention That Changed the World,"The world's first instant noodles were created in Japan in 1958 by Momofuku Ando, the founder of Nissin Foods. After witnessing widespread hunger in post-war Japan, Ando wanted to create a cheap, fast, and filling meal that anyone could prepare with just hot water. The result was Chikin Ramen ‚Äî the very first packaged instant noodle.\\n\\nAt the time, it was considered a luxury. It cost more than fresh noodles, but the convenience of a hot meal in minutes quickly caught on. By the 1960s, instant noodles were becoming popular across Asia, and in 1971, Ando introduced another revolutionary idea: Cup Noodles ‚Äî noodles in a disposable foam cup, where boiling water could be poured directly.\\n\\nInstant noodles soon became a global phenomenon. Their long shelf life, low cost, and simplicity made them a favorite among students, busy workers, and even astronauts ‚Äî instant ramen was adapted for space travel by the Japanese space agency and Nissin.\\n\\nToday, billions of servings of instant noodles are eaten worldwide every year.

cmcbuoj3f007avwbrlbith3p8,cmc0apnf90038qoublubz4128,"The Origin of the Word ""Hacker""","The term ""hacker"" originated in the 1960s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It came from the word ""hack,"" meaning to cut roughly, and evolved into student slang for clever technical work or creative engineering solutions. At MIT, a hacker was someone who found imaginative ways to solve problems in programming and electronics. This culture of inventive thinking was later reflected in The Jargon File and in Steven Levy's book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution.\\n\\nEven earlier, in the 1920s, ""hack"" was used to describe amateur or rough work. By the 1960s, the term had become a compliment for skilled programmers who could ""hack"" a system not to damage it, but to explore and improve it.\\n\\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the meaning of the word began to shift. Some individuals, known as ""phreakers,"" started using technical knowledge to manipulate telephone systems. As media attention grew, ""hacker"" started to be associated with computer crime. By the early 1980s, the word was widely viewed in a negative light.\\n\\nThe tech community responded by proposing distinctions based on intent: white hat hackers for ethical professionals, black hats for malicious attackers, and grey hats for those operating in between. Still, the broader public often continued to link the word ""hacker"" with illegal activity.\\n\\nToday, the word carries both meanings. In the tech world, it still refers to a curious, creative expert. In popular usage, it often implies a criminal. Despite the shift in perception, the original idea behind hacking remains‚Äîan expression of curiosity, ingenuity, and the drive to understand how things work.",image,Tech,/media/thumbposts/thumb_tech_1752770051_7557.webp,/media/posts/post_tech_1752770080_4204.webp,f,f,,SOL,5,0,0,2025-06-25 11:07:39.051,2025-07-18 03:50:12.569,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/db1766d01290fc85d666b6b70ae01417.webp,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/images/thumb_db1766d01290fc85d666b6b70ae01417.webp,,f,

This AI, named Flynn, was accepted into the Digital Arts department and has set a historic precedent in the world of education and technology.\\n\\nFlynn is not just a chatbot, but a complex system that combines a language model, a visual generator, and speech synthesis modules. It applied like any regular student‚Äîsubmitting a portfolio, passing an interview, and completing an entrance exam. Its work‚Äîdigital collages and visual narratives created using AI tools‚Äîimpressed the admissions committee with their originality and artistic vision.\\n\\nThe goal of the project is to explore how AI can participate in education on equal footing with human students: completing assignments, engaging in critiques, and learning theoretical concepts. Flynn is already attending classes, receiving grades, and even joining discussions with students and professors through speech synthesis and chat interface. Although overseen by academic mentors, Flynn is granted a degree of autonomy as part of the experiment.\\n\\nCampus reactions are mixed. Some view it as a bold leap into the future; others express concern over creativity, authorship, and fairness. Key questions arise: Who owns Flynn's artworks? Can it earn a diploma? What are the ethical boundaries of AI in education?\\n\\nNonetheless, Flynn's case is already a milestone‚Äîa turning point in the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence.

This marks the second time in a month that Nvidia has overtaken its rivals in total market value.\\n\\nAt the annual shareholders meeting, CEO Jensen Huang reaffirmed the company's strategic focus on artificial intelligence and robotics. He emphasized that the Nvidia Drive platform will be fundamental to the transition toward software-defined vehicles and highlighted the importance of this transformation in the near future.\\n\\nDespite export restrictions on H20 AI chips to China‚Äîwhich may cost the company around $8 billion in the second quarter‚Äîinvestor confidence remains strong. Huang described the export bans as a setback that, in his view, only accelerated technological advancement within China itself. In the most recent fiscal year, Nvidia generated $17.1 billion in revenue from China, accounting for 13.1% of its total and representing a 66% increase year-over-year.\\n\\nSince the beginning of 2025, Nvidia shares have gained nearly 15%. Investors continue to view the company as a key player in the development of AI, automotive electronics, and cloud computing, despite geopolitical risks and export limitations.

cmcel6d1g001h10tgsc1bvto5,cmbvtqy84000gqowpvlo2r5tp,From Military Roots to Rally Domination: The Audi Quattro Story,"In the late 1970s, Audi engineers were searching for a way to distinguish themselves from the competition and create something truly innovative. The breakthrough came during winter testing of the Volkswagen Iltis, a military off-road vehicle that displayed remarkable traction thanks to its four-wheel-drive system. One of Audi's engineers, J√∂rg Bensinger, observed how easily the Iltis handled snowy terrain and suggested adapting a similar concept for a passenger car.\\n\\nThe idea caught the attention of Audi's technical director, Ferdinand Pi√´ch, known for his relentless pursuit of engineering excellence. The challenge was to design a compact, lightweight, and efficient permanent all-wheel-drive system suitable for mass production. Instead of using a bulky transfer case, the team created a unique layout with a center differential and a hollow driveshaft that transmitted power to the rear axle.\\n\\nIn 1980, Audi unveiled the first production model equipped with this system ‚Äî the Audi quattro. The car caused an immediate sensation: a turbocharged sports coupe with aggressive styling and a revolutionary drivetrain. But the true test came on the world rally stage. Despite initial skepticism from competitors, the quattro delivered extraordinary results, providing unmatched grip on gravel, snow, and ice.\\n\\nIn 1982, Audi secured its first WRC victory, and by 1983 and 1984, it had claimed the world championship. The quattro system fundamentally changed rally racing, ended rear-wheel-drive dominance, and set a new performance benchmark. Audi's innovation quickly became a symbol of technical excellence.\\n\\nOver time, the technology evolved ‚Äî from mechanical to electronic systems ‚Äî but the core principle of optimal traction remained. The name ""quattro"" became synonymous with control, stability, and engineering superiority, shaping Audi's identity around progress and precision.",image,Tech,/media/thumbposts/thumb_tech_1752770011_9461.webp,/media/posts/post_tech_1752770000_9537.webp,f,f,,SOL,1,0,0,2025-06-27 09:04:53.38,2025-07-18 03:50:12.55,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/2cd1b03564a5012bedf1c86b008db2cb.jpg,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/images/thumb_2cd1b03564a5012bedf1c86b008db2cb.webp,,f,

cmchwpgiq000514n35f93vvfs,cmbvtqy84000gqowpvlo2r5tp,Mercedes Extends the Life of Combustion Engines,"Mercedes-Benz has changed its strategy: the company will no longer completely abandon internal combustion engines (ICEs) by 2030, as previously planned. Instead, the brand will continue to develop electrified gasoline and diesel engines, including hybrids.\\n\\nCompany CEO Ola K√§llenius explained this by pointing to the slowing growth of the electric vehicle (EV) market. Although EV sales continue to grow, the pace has been significantly below expectations. Therefore, Mercedes has decided not to rely solely on electric power, but to maintain a flexible approach.\\n\\nThis kind of course correction is now being observed among nearly all major automakers that had earlier announced a full phase-out of ICEs. The reason is simple: electric cars have not become affordable or accessible, and after the removal of government subsidies in many countries, they've become even more expensive than traditional cars. As a result, actual consumer demand has proven weaker than projected.\\n\\nMoreover, automakers have already invested billions into the development of electric vehicles‚Äîincluding batteries, platforms, and new production lines. However, a full transition to EVs has not been successful, and now, in order not to write off those investments as losses, companies are turning to hybrid solutions. This allows them to use already-developed technologies (batteries, software, architecture) in combination with ICEs and at least partially recover the costs.\\n\\nAs a result, the focus is increasingly shifting toward hybridization as the most realistic and commercially viable path under current market conditions.\\n\\nDespite this, Mercedes‚Äîlike BMW and Audi‚Äîwill continue to produce electric vehicles alongside ICE models at least through the mid-2030s, adapting to regulations in different countries.",image,Tech,/media/thumbposts/thumb_tech_1752770111_3579.webp,/media/posts/post_tech_1752770071_4156.webp,f,f,,SOL,3,0,0,2025-06-29 16:50:58.658,2025-07-18 03:50:12.595,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/b072f28d4f42f5c115ef7bf23497dbe2.webp,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/images/thumb_b072f28d4f42f5c115ef7bf23497dbe2.webp,,f,

cmcisyg76002c51bo0w3w7clo,cmbvtqy84000gqowpvlo2r5tp,Leaded Gasoline: From Revolution to Poison ,"In the early 20th century, engineers sought to improve the performance of automotive fuel. In 1921, American chemist Thomas Midgley Jr., working for General Motors, discovered that adding tetraethyl lead (TEL) significantly increased gasoline's octane rating. Thus, leaded gasoline was born ‚Äî a fuel that allowed engines to run more powerfully and smoothly without destructive knocking. It quickly became the global standard, supported by GM, Standard Oil, and DuPont.\\n\\nBut as early as the 1920s, troubling signs emerged. Workers at TEL production plants suffered from severe poisoning and hallucinations. Midgley himself fell ill from lead exposure, despite publicly demonstrating the ""safety"" of the compound. Yet industrial giants suppressed criticism, dismissing it as panic and pseudoscience.\\n\\nThe real blow to leaded gasoline came in the 1960s from scientist Clair Patterson. Studying lead levels in the atmosphere and human bones, he showed that contamination had reached a global scale. Lead was entering the air, soil, water, and the bloodstream of millions ‚Äî especially children. Its connection to developmental delays, reduced IQ, and neurological disorders became undeniable.\\n\\nDespite resistance from industry, restrictions began in the U.S. in the 1970s. By 1986, leaded gasoline was banned for passenger vehicles, and by the 1990s, many other countries followed. But the process took decades. The last country to phase it out completely was Algeria ‚Äî in 2021.\\n\\nOnce a symbol of progress, leaded gasoline is now seen as one of the greatest environmental mistakes of the 20th century. Its widespread use poisoned entire generations, and its consequences are still felt today.\\n",image,Tech,/media/thumbposts/thumb_tech_1752770139_5865.webp,/media/posts/post_tech_1752770093_1463.webp,f,f,,SOL,2,1,0,2025-06-30 07:53:45.858,2025-07-18 03:50:12.626,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/710c3d9ed62de16def886755bcd39a09.jpg,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/images/thumb_710c3d9ed62de16def886755bcd39a09.webp,,f,

cmca7fbnn008sqosu9h47lnug,cmbvtqy84000gqowpvlo2r5tp,"Group B: Speed, Danger, and the Legend of Rally's Wildest Era","Group B was a short-lived but legendary era in rally history, lasting from 1982 to 1986. Known for its lack of restrictions, extreme performance, and danger, it produced some of the most iconic rally cars ever built. Under the FIA's liberal regulations, manufacturers only had to produce 200 road-going versions of a model to compete, and there were almost no limits on power, weight, or technology. This led to the creation of turbocharged, all-wheel-drive beasts like the Audi Quattro S1, Peugeot 205 T16, Lancia Delta S4, and Ford RS200. Some of these cars exceeded 500 horsepower and could accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in under three seconds, even on dirt.\\n\\nThe spectacle was unmatched, with massive crowds lining the stages, often dangerously close to the cars. However, the combination of raw power, unpredictable terrain, and poor safety measures led to a series of accidents. In 1986, the fatal crash of Henri Toivonen and his co-driver Sergio Cresto in a Lancia Delta S4 marked a turning point. FIA responded by banning Group B cars at the end of that season, ending an era that was as tragic as it was thrilling.\\n\\nThough short-lived, Group B left a lasting legacy. It's remembered as the wildest and most exciting chapter in rallying, a time when innovation reigned and the limits of speed were pushed to their edge.",image,Art,/media/thumbposts/thumb_art_1752770011_1528.webp,/media/posts/post_art_1752769936_9756.webp,f,f,,SOL,2,0,0,2025-06-24 07:28:52.163,2025-07-18 03:50:11.399,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/82b106060d7a7452ac1063a62abea25c.jpeg,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/images/thumb_82b106060d7a7452ac1063a62abea25c.webp,,f,

In cooperation with its partners Mahle and Trumpf, the sports car manufacturer is now establishing a new milestone in the use of additive manufacturing processes for highly-stressed drive components ‚Äì for the first time, the pistons for the high-performance engine of the 911 flagship model, the GT2 RS, are now also being produced with a 3D printer.\\n\\n3D printing allows the pistons to be manufactured with a structure that is optimised for the loads acting on the pistons. As a result, the pistons from the advance development project weigh ten percent less than the forged series production pistons. They also have an integrated and closed cooling duct in the piston crown that could not have been produced by conventional methods. ""Thanks to the new, lighter pistons, we can increase the engine speed, lower the temperature load on the pistons and optimise combustion,"" explains Frank Ickinger from the advance drive development department at Porsche. ""This makes it possible to get up to 30 PS more power from the 700 PS biturbo engine, while at the same time improving efficiency.""",image,Technology,/media/thumbposts/thumb_tech_1752770127_7921.webp,/media/posts/post_gaming_1752770366_5371.webp,f,f,,SOL,8,0,0,2025-06-21 18:49:31.137,2025-07-18 03:50:12.621,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/8986159749dc7a7c510bba34ff100c4d.jpg,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/images/thumb_8986159749dc7a7c510bba34ff100c4d.webp,,f,

cmc7gmiaq00m1qoqgutdkg2pb,cmc0apnf90038qoublubz4128,Mushroom Mycelium Packaging: A Sustainable Alternative to Plastic,"Mushroom mycelium packaging is an innovative, eco-friendly material made by combining the root structure of mushrooms (mycelium) with agricultural waste such as hemp fibers or corn husks. Instead of producing sheets of material that are later cut or shaped, mycelium packaging is actually grown into a mold that matches the desired shape. Over the course of 5 to 7 days, the mycelium spreads through the plant substrate, binding it into a solid, custom form.\\n\\nOnce the form is complete, the packaging is heat-treated to stop the growth and ensure it is safe, clean, and durable. The final product is lightweight, strong, and fully biodegradable. It effectively protects fragile goods during shipping‚Äîjust like polystyrene or other plastic foams‚Äîbut unlike plastic, it will break down naturally in compost or soil within weeks, leaving no harmful waste behind.\\n\\nAs consumers and companies look for alternatives to single-use plastics, mycelium packaging offers a promising solution. It's not only better for the environment, but it also turns agricultural byproducts into valuable, functional products, contributing to a circular economy. Major brands like IKEA have already adopted mushroom packaging as an eco-friendly alternative, using it to replace plastic foam for protecting products during shipping.",image,Technology,/media/thumbposts/thumb_education_1752770502_7263.webp,/media/posts/post_gaming_1752770312_2215.webp,f,f,,SOL,4,0,0,2025-06-22 09:23:05.378,2025-07-18 03:50:11.549,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/2dab1f6bccc5cc10c54bfdbe2744c907.avif,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/images/thumb_2dab1f6bccc5cc10c54bfdbe2744c907.webp,,f,

To solve this, computer scientists Quentin Stafford-Fraser and Paul Jardetzky set up a camera pointing at the office coffee machine. The camera was connected to their internal network, allowing everyone in the lab to check the coffee status from their desks. The image was low resolution ‚Äî just 128x128 pixels ‚Äî but it did the job.\\n\\nInitially, the feed was only available within the lab. But in 1993, when the World Wide Web was becoming public, the camera feed was connected to the internet by another researcher, Daniel Gordon. This made it the first webcam in history to stream live images online.\\n\\nThe coffee pot, known as the ""Trojan Room coffee pot"", quickly gained global attention and became a quirky symbol of early internet culture. It remained online until 2001, when the camera was finally switched off.\\n\\nWhat started as a practical office joke ended up shaping the way we think about connecting cameras to networks.

With 156 tight turns, steep cliffs, and rapidly changing weather, it's a battle against nature, gravity, and machine.\\n\\nFor decades, much of the course was gravel, adding to the danger.

cmcelqt1s001x10tghokwnkqp,cmc0apnf90038qoublubz4128,Windows Says Goodbye to the Blue Screen of Death.,"Windows is saying goodbye to one of its most iconic symbols ‚Äî the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). In the upcoming Windows 11 update version 24H2, scheduled for summer 2025, Microsoft will replace the blue background with black. This change is part of a broader initiative to improve system reliability after a massive global outage caused by a faulty CrowdStrike update that affected millions of computers.\\n\\nThe new screen will appear cleaner and more modern. The sad face and QR code are gone, the error text has been simplified, and now includes more precise information pointing to the specific driver that caused the crash. A progress indicator in percentage will also be displayed, giving users a better sense of what's happening during system recovery.\\n\\nThe update will also introduce Quick Machine Recovery ‚Äî a feature that allows for automatic recovery from serious crashes without manual intervention. This is especially useful for enterprise environments and system administrators who need to restore workstations quickly.\\n\\nThe switch from blue to black is more than just a cosmetic change. It's a step toward making critical system errors less intimidating for users and easier to diagnose.",image,Tech,/media/thumbposts/thumb_tech_1752770100_4248.webp,/media/posts/post_tech_1752770083_6145.webp,f,f,,SOL,1,0,0,2025-06-27 09:20:47.248,2025-07-18 03:50:12.584,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/4e78a82a3916e33ddf8d1518a1cc0833.jpg,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/images/thumb_4e78a82a3916e33ddf8d1518a1cc0833.webp,,f,

In response, Ford invested millions into developing the GT40 supercar and brought in top talent like Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles.\\n\\nAfter setbacks in 1964‚Äì65, Ford returned in 1966 with an improved GT40 Mk II powered by a mighty 7-liter V8. The cars showed incredible endurance and speed.\\n\\nThe finish was iconic: three Fords crossed the line together, symbolizing total dominance. This marked the beginning of Ford's four-year winning streak at Le Mans from 1966 to 1969.\\n\\nIt was also a historic first ‚Äî Ford became the first American car manufacturer to win Le Mans overall, with an all-American chassis, engine, and team. Until then, no American brand had ever conquered the French endurance race. Ford didn't just win ‚Äî it made a statement that echoed through racing history.",image,Tech,/media/thumbposts/thumb_tech_1752770120_4882.webp,/media/posts/post_tech_1752770015_8811.webp,f,f,,SOL,1,0,0,2025-06-28 07:51:38.235,2025-07-18 03:50:12.608,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/7e98ccb19469b59ea57c6aa4eeb98372.jpeg,https://iwzfrnfemdeomowothhn.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/posts/images/thumb_7e98ccb19469b59ea57c6aa4eeb98372.webp,,f,
