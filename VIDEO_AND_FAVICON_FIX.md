# Video Playback and Favicon Implementation

## Date: June 19, 2025

### Issues Fixed

1. **Video Playback in Feed**
   - Videos were showing broken links and returning 404 errors
   - Users couldn't play videos directly in the feed

2. **Missing Favicon**
   - Website had no favicon/icon
   - No icons for mobile bookmarks

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Video Playback Fix

**Component Updated**: `components/OptimizedImage.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added inline video player functionality
- Video now plays on click without redirecting
- Added play/pause controls
- Smooth transition from thumbnail to video player

**How it works**:
1. Initially shows video thumbnail with play button overlay
2. On click, replaces thumbnail with HTML5 video element
3. Automatically starts playback
4. Shows native video controls for seeking, volume, etc.

#### 2. Favicon Implementation

**Files Created**:
- `/public/favicon.ico` (symlink to favicon.png)
- `/public/favicon.png` (32x32)
- `/public/favicon-16x16.png`
- `/public/favicon-32x32.png`
- `/public/favicon-48x48.png`
- `/public/apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180)

**Script Created**: `scripts/generate-favicons.py`
- Uses Python Pillow library to generate favicons from logo
- Creates multiple sizes for different devices
- Can be run anytime to regenerate icons

**Metadata Updated**: `app/layout.tsx`
- Added favicon references
- Added Open Graph metadata
- Added Apple touch icon

### Deployment

All changes have been deployed to production:
- ✅ Videos now play correctly at https://fonana.me
- ✅ Favicon visible in browser tabs
- ✅ Icons work for mobile bookmarks

### Testing
