# Product Context: Fonana

## Why This Project Exists

Fonana addresses the fundamental problem of creator monetization in the digital economy. Traditional platforms take high fees (20-30%), have complex payout systems, and give creators little control over their audience relationships.

## Problems We Solve

### For Creators
1. **High Platform Fees**: Traditional platforms take 20-30% cuts
2. **Limited Monetization Options**: Only ads, sponsorships, or basic subscriptions
3. **No Direct Audience Ownership**: Platform controls creator-audience relationship
4. **Delayed Payments**: Weeks/months to receive earnings
5. **Platform Dependency**: Risk of account suspension or algorithm changes

### For Subscribers/Fans
1. **Lack of Direct Creator Support**: No easy way to support favorite creators
2. **Impersonal Experience**: No direct interaction with creators
3. **Content Discovery Issues**: Hard to find niche creators
4. **Payment Friction**: Complex payment processes
