# Video Thumbnails Update

## Date: June 19, 2025

### Issue
Video posts in the feed were showing with a basic placeholder, making it unclear what video content would be shown when clicked.

### Solution
1. **Created Enhanced Video Placeholder**
   - Generated a cinematic film-strip style placeholder image
   - Added visual elements: film strips, play button, grid pattern
   - More visually appealing than basic placeholder

2. **Updated Video Upload Process**
   - Modified `/api/posts/upload` to return enhanced placeholder for videos
   - Ensures consistent thumbnail experience across the platform

3. **Updated Components**
   - `CreatePostModal`: Now uses enhanced placeholder for video posts
   - `EditPostModal`: Updated to maintain enhanced placeholder when editing
   - `OptimizedImage`: Already properly displays video thumbnails

### Files Modified
- `/app/api/posts/upload/route.ts` - Returns enhanced placeholder for videos
- `/components/CreatePostModal.tsx` - Uses enhanced placeholder
- `/components/EditPostModal.tsx` - Maintains enhanced placeholder
- `/public/placeholder-video-enhanced.png` - New enhanced placeholder image

### Visual Improvements
- Film strip borders for cinematic feel
- Centered play button with semi-transparent background
- Subtle grid pattern overlay
- Better contrast and visibility

### Future Enhancements
Consider implementing:
1. Real video frame extraction using ffmpeg
2. Dynamic thumbnail generation with video metadata
3. Multiple thumbnail options for users to choose from
4. Animated GIF previews on hover
