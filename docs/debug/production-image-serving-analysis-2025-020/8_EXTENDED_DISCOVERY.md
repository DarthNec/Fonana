## üö® **NEW PROBLEM SCOPE**

### **Problem Re-Emergence:**
‚úÖ **lafufu test image**: HTTP 200 OK (0612cc5b000dcff7ed9879dbc86942cf.JPG)
‚ùå **Other images**: Still HTTP 404 (multiple files)
‚ùå **New posts**: Still showing placeholders
‚ùå **User experience**: Problem NOT fully resolved

### **Console Evidence:**
```javascript
[useOptimizedPosts] Received 20 posts from API ‚úÖ
[useOptimizedPosts] Normalized 20 posts successfully ‚úÖ

// BUT:
2c034459c477a15cccb366dd8eaaa410.JPG:1 Failed to load resource: 404 ‚ùå

```

## üéØ **CRITICAL REALIZATION**

### **Partial Success Analysis:**
Our normal mode solution worked for **ONE specific file** but not for **ALL uploaded files**.

**This suggests:**
1. ‚úÖ **Normal mode works** (serving mechanism correct)
2. ‚ùå **File availability issue** (some files missing/mislocated)
3. ‚ùå **Scope underestimation** (problem bigger than single file)

## üîç **DISCOVERY PLAN**

### **Phase 1: File System Audit** 
- [ ] Check production file structure for ALL images
- [ ] Compare local vs production file availability  
- [ ] Analyze upload path vs serving path consistency

### **Phase 2: API Response Analysis**
- [ ] Verify API returns correct mediaUrl paths
- [ ] Check database vs filesystem consistency
- [ ] Analyze recent uploads vs old uploads

### **Phase 3: Upload Process Investigation**
- [ ] Trace complete upload flow
- [ ] Verify where new files are actually saved
- [ ] Check if upload process was affected by normal mode change

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **HYPOTHESIS**

### **Most Likely Causes:**
1. **File Location Mismatch**: Files uploaded to wrong directory during transition
2. **Incomplete File Migration**: Some files not copied during standalone‚Üínormal transition
3. **Upload Process Bug**: New uploads going to old standalone path
4. **Nginx Path Issue**: Serving from wrong location despite normal mode

---

## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED**

### **Discovery Tasks:**
1. **SSH Production Audit** - Check actual file locations
2. **Database Query** - Get all mediaUrl patterns from recent posts
3. **Upload Test** - Create new post and trace file path
4. **Network Analysis** - Verify requested vs served paths

**Status: DISCOVERY IN PROGRESS**
