## 🔒 **SECURITY IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

### Security Risks During Rebuild:
- 🟢 **Credential exposure**: Very low (using existing secure transfer methods)
- 🟢 **Code injection**: Not applicable (no user input during rebuild)
- 🟡 **Configuration drift**: Low (manual verification required)
- 🟢 **Access control**: No changes to authentication systems

### Security Benefits:
- ✅ Fresh build eliminates potential backdoors in corrupted webpack bundles
- ✅ Updated dependencies may include security patches
- ✅ Clean deployment environment reduces attack surface
